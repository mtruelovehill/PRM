## Learning Objectives
At the end of this lab, you will be able to:

1.  Import data into SPSS
2.  Check and reset variable types and codes
3.  Check the descriptive statistics of your data
4.  Produce histograms to visually assess your data's distribution

## Lab Requirements
To complete this lab, you should have:

- [ ] &nbsp; Attended this week's lectures
- [ ] &nbsp; Installed SPSS on your computer


## Lab Tasks


### Import Data {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

#### Task Description
Import Data into SPSS
Describe some data here. Provide the link to download the data. 

#### Hint
Click the *File* tab in SPSS. What is the difference between the 'Open' and 'Import Data' options? What is the file type of ''Week1LabData'?

#### Solution
Click *Import Data* under the **File** tab. The data are in .csv format, so choose *CSV data*. Navigate to the folder where you've stored  'Week1LabData.csv' and select the file. In this case, the first row is the name for each column, so the 'First line contains variable names' should remain checked. Note that if you import data without column names, you'll need to uncheck this box. Click 'OK'.
