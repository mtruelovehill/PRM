## Identify Normal Distribution Thresholds 

A normal distribution is a unimodal distribution of data in which observations fall symmetrically around the mean. Use the sliders to adjust the mean and standard deviation of the data to explore their effects on the shape of the distribution.   

```{r, echo = F}

fluidRow(column(4, 
  sliderInput("mean","Value of Mean:", min = -6, max = 6, value = 0, step = 2),
  sliderInput('sd', 'Value of SD:', min = 1, max = 5, value = 1, step = .25)),
  column(8, plotOutput('distPlot')))

tags$style(HTML(".js-irs-0 .irs-single, .js-irs-0 .irs-bar-edge, .js-irs-0 .irs-bar {background: #4CA384}"))
tags$style(HTML(".js-irs-1 .irs-single, .js-irs-1 .irs-bar-edge, .js-irs-1 .irs-bar {background: #4CA384}"))


```

Remember that a perfectly normal distribution has the following criteria:

+ 68% of scores fall within 1 SD of the mean
+ 95% of scores fall within 1.96 SD of the mean
+ 99.75% of scores fall within 3 SD of the mean

### Your Task 
+ [ ] $\ $ Using these criteria, answer the following questions. You may need to use a calculator.

```{r q8, echo = FALSE}
quiz(caption = '',
     question_numeric('If scores on Assessment A were perfectly normally distributed, there would be symmetrical upper and lower thresholds between which 95% of scores would fall. What is the upper threshold value? Please round your answer to 2 decimal places.',
              answer(48.28, correct = T),
              tolerance = .02,
              message = 'See the solution below'),
     question_numeric('If scores on Assessment D were perfectly normally distributed, there would be symmetrical upper and lower thresholds between which 99.75% of scores would fall. What is the lower threshold value? Please round your answer to 2 decimal places.',
              answer(75.51, correct=T),
              tolerance = .02,
              message = 'See the solution below'),
     question('Imagine the age variable is perfectly normally distributed. What is the age range within which 68% of the sample falls?',
              answer('[15.30, 30.78]', correct=T),
              answer('[7.87, 38.21]'),
              answer('[19.00, 24.50]'),
              answer('[7.56, 38.52]'),
              random_answer_order = T,
              message = 'See the solution below')
)
```

You'll need to get two values from SPSS for each variable to perform these calculations. You may find it helpful to review the normal distribution material from the <span style = "color:#9AD079"><B><a href="https://mtruelovehill.github.io/PRM/Lectures/Week01_ExploringData_Lecture.html#1" target="_blank">lecture</a></span></B>.

You'll need to extract the mean and standard deviation for each variable from SPSS:

```{r, echo = F}
descDat <- data.frame(Variable=c('A', 'D', 'Age'), Mean = c(39.09, 81.96, 23.04),SD=c(4.69, 2.15, 7.74))

descDat %>%
  kbl(table.attr = "style = \"color: white;\"") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = T, color='white', font_size = 18, align='l') %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = T)
```


We know that a normal distribution is symmetrical with the mean as its center point, so to get these thresholds, we can use the following equations:</span>

**68%:** $\bar{x}\ \pm\ 1\times s$

**95%:** $\bar{x}\ \pm\ 1.96\times s$

**99.75%:** $\bar{x}\ \pm\ 3\times s$


So, for example, to get the upper 95% threshold for Assessment A, you would use the following equation:

$$39.09+1.96\times 4.69 = `r round(39.09+(1.96*4.69),2)`$$

To get the lower 99.75% threshold, as in the second question, you just subtract instead of add:

$$81.96-3\times 2.15 = `r round(81.96-(3*2.15),2)`$$

To get the range of data in which 68% of observations fall, as in the third question, you'll do both:

$$23.04-1\times 7.74 = `r round(23.04-(1*7.74),2)`$$

$$23.04+1\times 7.74 = `r round(23.04+(1*7.74),2)`$$

## Evaluating Normality

Recall from the lecture that many of the statistical tests we'll be learning about work most effectively with normally distributed data. It's important that you understand how to evaluate whether your data are normally distributed, or whether they're skewed or kurtotic. 

```{r, echo = F, fig.height=2}


fluidRow(column(6,
  sliderTextInput(inputId = "skew",label = "Skewness", choices = c('Negatively Skewed', 'Somewhat Negatively Skewed',
                                                                 'Normal', 'Somewhat Positively Skewed', 
                                                                 'Positively Skewed'), selected = 'Normal'),
  plotOutput('skewPlot'), style='padding-left:50px; padding-right:10px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px'),
  column(6, sliderTextInput(inputId = "kurt",label = "Kurtosis", choices = c('Platykurtic', 'Somewhat Platykurtic',
                                                                 'Normal', 'Somewhat Leptokurtic', 
                                                                 'Leptokurtic'), selected = 'Normal'),
         plotOutput('kurtPlot'), style='padding-left:50px; padding-right:30px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px'))

tags$style(HTML(".js-irs-2 .irs-single, .js-irs-2 .irs-bar-edge, .js-irs-2 .irs-bar {background: #4CA384}"))
tags$style(HTML(".js-irs-3 .irs-single, .js-irs-3 .irs-bar-edge, .js-irs-3 .irs-bar {background: #4CA384}"))

```

### Your Task 
Evaluate the normality of your continuous variables by visually checking the histograms, assessing the skewness and kurtosis values, and running an appropriate statistical test. 

```{r q9, echo = FALSE}
quiz(caption = 'Test Your Understanding',
     question('Which statistical test is most appropriate for use to check normality in the current dataset?',
              answer('Shapiro-Wilk Test', correct = T),
              answer('Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov Test'),
              answer('t-Test'),
              answer('Pearson Correlation'),
              random_answer_order = T,
              message = 'The Shapiro-Wilk test is appropriate for use with smaller datasets (n < 50), while the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test should be used with datasets of 50 observations or more. t-Tests and Pearson correlations are not used to measure normality in data.'),
     question('Do any of the assessments violate normality, according to the statistical test you selected?',
              answer('Assessment A'),
              answer('Assessment B', correct=T),
              answer('Assessment C'),
              answer('Assessment D'),
              message = 'See the solution below. Both the normality test and the histogram suggest that scores on Assessment B are skewed.'),
     question_numeric('What is the skewness value of Assessment C?',
              answer(-.018, correct=T),
              message = 'See the solution below. Due to a sample of less than 50, you should be using the results from the Shapiro-Wilk test.'),
     question_numeric('What is the kurtosis value of Assessment D?',
              answer(.385, correct=T),
              message = 'See the solution below. Due to a sample of less than 50, you should be using the results from the Shapiro-Wilk test.')
)
```

You'll find the *Analyze>Descriptive Statistics>Explore* tab helpful here. As results from two types of normality tests are reported, be sure you understand which you should choose to report.

Unfortunately, checking normality is not especially straightforward in SPSS. Navigate to the *Analyze>Descriptive Statistics>Explore* tab and add the variables you would like to test to the Dependent List box. Click 'Display: Plots', then click the *Plots* box. In the window that opens, check the 'Normality plots with tests' box, then select 'Histogram' under *Descriptive*. Click 'Continue', then 'OK'.

```{r, echo = F, out.width='60%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/PRM/Labs/images/week1_9a.PNG')
```

The normality tests will display under the 'Tests of Normality' heading. As these tests are checking whether the distribution of your variables is significantly different from a normal distribution, a significant result suggests a variable violates normality (i.e., is not normally distributed). We'll learn more about significance and $p$-values later in the course, but for now, we'll consider a $p$-value less than .05 to be significant. To assess the $p$-values, check the 'Sig.' column. In this case, we'll look at the results for the Shapiro-Wilk test since we have a sample of less than 50 participants. Here, the $p$-value associated with Assessment B is less than .05, so this suggests that scores on Assessment B are not normally distributed.

```{r, echo = F, out.width='70%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/PRM/Labs/images/week1_9b.PNG')
```

If you check the histogram, you can confirm that there is a ceiling effect in that most students score near the maximum possible score, leading to negatively skewed data.

```{r, echo = F, out.width='70%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/PRM/Labs/images/week1_9c.PNG')
```
