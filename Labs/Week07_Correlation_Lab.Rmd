## Intro to Today's Lab

During today's lab, you'll apply the concepts discussed during this week's lecture. Each lab consists of a range of tasks, with corresponding questions you can answer. Please note that the questions are not required and not marked, although they do provide a helpful source of formative feedback that will help you gauge your understanding. 

### Learning Objectives
At the end of this lab, you will be able to:

1. Identify hypotheses which may be tested using correlations
2. Use SPSS to compute a composite score
3. Use SPSS to run a correlation
3. Properly interpret and report a correlation
4. Use the ggplot GUI to produce scatterplots, boxplots, and dot and error-bar plots


### This Week's Study

You'll be working with data adapted from [this study](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1612197X.2017.1367951#d1e287). The researchers investigated adolescent athletes who played team sports. One area the study investigated was whether self-enhancement values (e.g., valuing power and achievement) were associated with antisocial behaviour towards members of the opposing team. You'll be investigating this association directly; you'll also produce plots using other related variables in the dataset.

## Interpreting Correlations

MONICA - create an interactive plot that allows them to visualise different types of correlations.

## Experiment Overview

<br>
In this experiment, you recruited a sample of adolescents who participated in team sports. Participants have an average score for each of 4 measures associated with desire for power and achievement. These scores, when totaled together, will provide a measure that reflects a participant's self-enhancement values. Higher scores on this composite metric reflect stronger self-enhancement values. Participants also have an Antisocial Behaviour score, which reflects their average score on the antisocial items from the Prosocial and Antisocial Behavior in Sport Scale. Higher scores on this scale reflect a larger number of endorsed antisocial behaviours.  

You can download the dataset from the first experiment [here](https://mtruelovehill.github.io/PRM/Labs/Week7LabData.sav). It contains the following variables:

```{r, echo = F}
dat <- read.csv('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/PRM/Labs/Week7LabData.csv')
datInfo <- data.frame(VariableName = colnames(dat),
                      Description=c('Participant ID',
                                    'Age in years',
                                    'Levels: F = Female; M = Male',
                                    'Self-Enhancment Score 1; values may range between 0 - 6',
                                    'Self-Enhancment Score 2; values may range between 0 - 6',
                                    'Self-Enhancment Score 3; values may range between 0 - 6',
                                    'Self-Enhancment Score 4; values may range between 0 - 6',
                                    'Average Antisocial Behaviour Score; values may range from 1-5',
                                    'Self-Enhancement values as categories; Levels: High; Low',
                                    'Self-reported feelings of parental pressure; Levels: High; Low'))

datInfo %>%
  kbl(col.names=c('Variable Name', 'Description')) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = T, color=baseColor, font_size = 18, align='l') %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = T, width = '4.5cm')
```

You'll be investigating the association between student athletes' endorsement of self-enhancement values and reports of their antisocial behaviour towards members of the opposing team.

```{r q1, echo = FALSE}
quiz(caption = '',
     question("Which test is most appropriate to address your research question, given the study design?",
              answer("t-test"),
              answer("Factorial ANOVA"),
              answer("Correlation", correct = T),
              message = "Here, you're looking at the association between two continuous variables. Both a t-test and a Factorial ANOVA require a categorical dependent variable, so a correlation is the most appropriate of these three."))
```

## Data Review

Before running any analyses, you should first check your data. In many cases, some kind of cleaning or data wrangling will be necessary. For instance, are there any missing values? Do you have any unexpected values or extreme outliers? Do you need to create a variable from the existing data (e.g., a summary metric for a cognitive task)? These things should be dealt with before conducting the analyses.

Additionally, you'll need to compute descriptive data. You'll do this for both your main variables of interest and your sample's demographic data, as this must be included in the Sample portion of your Methods section. 

### Your Tasks

+ [ ] $\ $ Open 'Week7LabData.sav'

+ [ ] $\ $ Check that all variables are set as the correct measurement type. 

+ [ ] $\ $ Check the descriptive statistics of your data

+ [ ] $\ $ Compute a composite score, `SelfEnhancement`, by summing the following columns: `SE1`, `SE2`, `SE3`, and `SE4`

```{r cyr, echo = FALSE}
quiz(caption = 'Check Your Results',
     question_numeric("What is the mean score on SE1? Please round your answer to two decimal places.",
                      answer(3.17, correct = T),
                      message = "The mean SE1 score in your sample is 3.17."),
     question_numeric('What is the maximum value for AntisocialBehaviour? Please round your answer to two decimal places.',
                      answer(488.00, correct = T),
                      message = "The maximum Antisocial Behaviour score is 488, which is well outside the expected limits of 1-5. As a score of 488 is not possible, it is an error. It will need to be deleted so that it is excluded from further analysis."))
```

<div class="container">
<details><summary><span style = "font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt"> Click here for a hint </span></summary>

For continuous variables, the descriptive statistics you'll want to check are mean and standard deviation. It's also useful to check the minimum and maximum so you can easily identify values outside of your expected range. For categorical variables, you'll check the frequency of participants in each group. It may also be useful to check the mode.

To compute the self-enhancement composite score, you'll need to navigate to *Transform > Compute Variable*

<div class="container">
<details><summary><span style = "font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt"> Click here for the solution </span></summary>

<span style = "font-weight: bold; font-size: 14pt"> Adjust Variable Measure Format </span>

To check that your variables are labeled as the correct scale of measurement, look at the **Measure** column under the *Variable View* tab.

* `ID` - Ordinal

* `Age` - Scale

* `Gender` - Nominal

* `SE1` - Scale

* `SE2` - Scale

* `SE3` - Scale

* `AntisocialBehaviour` - Scale

* `SEcategory` - Nominal

* `ParentalPressure` - Nominal

In this instance, SPSS assigned the proper measures by default (with the exception of ID, which won't be used as part of any analysis, so you can ignore it if you'd like). No changes are required.

<br>
<span style = "font-weight: bold; font-size: 14pt"> Check Descriptive Statistics </span>

**Categorical Variables:** Your categorical variables are `Gender`, `SEcategory`, and `ParentalPressure`. Click *Analyze>Descriptive Statistics>Frequencies*, then add these variables to the 'Variable(s)' box. Make sure 'Display frequency tables' is checked, then click 'OK'. You should see the following output:

```{r, echo = F, fig.align= 'center', out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/PRM/Labs/images/week7_freqTables.png')
```


**Continuous Variables:** Your continuous variables are `SE1`, `SE2`, `SE3`, `SE4` and `AntisocialBehaviour`. Click *Analyze>Descriptive Statistics>Frequencies*, then add these variables to the 'Variable(s)' box. Make sure 'Display frequency tables' is not ticked, then click 'Statistics'. Tick 'Mean', 'Std. Deviation', 'Minimum', and 'Maximum'. Click 'Continue', then 'OK'. You should see the following output:

```{r, echo = F, fig.align= 'center', out.width = '40%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/PRM/Labs/images/week7_descStats.png')
```

Note that the maximum value for `AntisocialBehaviour` is 488, which is not a valid score. This is an error, so you'll need to remove it from your data so that it is not included in further analysis. To do this, find the value in your dataset under 'Data View' and delete it.

<br>
<span style = "font-weight: bold; font-size: 14pt"> Compute Composite Score </span>

To compute the composite score by summing together the SE columns, navigate to *Transform > Compute Variable*. Label your new variable `SelfEnhancement` in the 'Target Variable' box. In the 'Numeric Expression', add each SE column (`SE1`, `SE2`, `SE3`, and `SE4`) with a $+$ sign between them:

```{r, echo = F, fig.align= 'center', out.width = '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/PRM/Labs/images/week7_composite.png')
```

Click 'OK'. A new column labeled `SelfEnhancement` should appear that contains the sum of the 4 SE columns.

## Run Correlations

As you are testing for an association between two continuous variables, you'll use a correlation to provide statistical support for your hypotheses. 

Recall that $r$ has the following interpretation standards:

| Strength     | Magnitude of $r$ |
|:------------:|:----------------:|
| Negligible   | $<$ .1           |
| Weak         | .1 - .3          |
| Moderate     | .3 - .6          |
| Strong       | $>$ .6           |


### Your Tasks

+ [ ] $\ $ Run a correlation to test your hypotheses and interpret the results with $\alpha$ = .05.

+ [ ] $\ $ Produce a correlation matrix showing the correlations between each of the SE variables: `SE1`, `SE2`, `SE3`, and `SE4`


```{r cyrCorr, echo = FALSE}
quiz(caption = 'Check Your Results',
     question_numeric("What is the Pearson correlation value for the association between AntisocialBehaviour and SelfEnhancement? Please round your answer to two decimal places.",
              answer(.31, correct = T),
              message = "Pearson's r for the association between AntisocialBehaviour and SelfEnhancement is .31."),
     question("Which of the following pairs have the weakest association?",
              answer("SE1 & SE2"),
              answer("SE1 & SE3"),
              answer('SE1 & SE4', correct = T),
              message = "Pearson's r for the association between SE1 & SE4 is only .30. For the association between SE1 & SE3, it is .49, and for the association between SE1 & SE2, it is .54."))
```

<div class="container">
<details><summary><span style = "font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt"> + Click here for a hint </span></summary>

To run a correlation, you'll need to navigate to *Analyze > Correlate > Bivariate*

</details>
</div>
</br>

<div class="container">
<details><summary><span style = "font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt"> + Click here for the solution </span></summary>

To correlate `SelfEnhancement` with `AntisocialBehaviour`, navigate to *Analyze > Correlate > Bivariate* and add both of these to the 'Variables' box. You can specify that you'd like to also compute the relevant confidence intervals by selecting 'Confidence interval' box and ticking the 'Estimate confidence intervals of the bivariate correlation parameter' box. Click 'Continue' and then 'OK'. You'll get the following output:

```{r, echo = F, fig.align= 'center', out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/PRM/Labs/images/week7_correlationResults.png')
```

The top box provides a correlation matrix with the value of $r$ and the p-value, while the bottom box gives the confidence interval associated with the correlation. Here, you can see that $r$ = .3, which equates to a weak to moderate association between `SelfEnhancement` and `AntisocialBehaviour`. The $p$-value (< .001) is less than the $\alpha$ threshold of .05, so this association is significant. The 95% confidence interval indicates that we can be 95% confident that the true association ($r$) between these two variables falls between .17 and .44. 

You can correlate the SE variables in the same way as above. This time, click 'Show only the lower diagonal'. This removes redundant information from the correlation matrix, which is how correlation matrices are typically presented:

```{r, echo = F, fig.align= 'center', out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/PRM/Labs/images/week7_correlationMatrix.png')
```

Here, you can see that all variables are significantly associated with each other, which you would expect given that they are supposed to measure the same construct.

## Using ggPlot GUI for visualisation

Often, visualisations of your results allows outside reader's to more easily interpret your findings. Effective visualisations allow you to present your results more clearly and efficiently than describing them in text alone. As a psychology student, you will almost always need to follow APA-style when producing figures. SPSS does not always produce customisable, APA-style figures. Here, you'll learn how to use the [ggplot GUI website](https://shiny.gmw.rug.nl/ggplotgui/) to produce 3 common types of plots.

### Your Tasks

+ [ ] $\ $ Create an APA-style scatterplot with `SelfEnhancement` on the x-axis and `AntisocialBehaviour` on the y-axis. Please include a regression line.

+ [ ] $\ $ Create an APA-style boxplot with `SEcategory` on the x-axis and `AntisocialBehaviour` on the y-axis.

+ [ ] $\ $ Create an APA-style dot-and-error plot with `SEcategory` on the x-axis, `AntisocialBehaviour` on the y-axis, and `ParentalPressure` as the Group variable. Please include a regression line.

```{r cyrPlots, echo = FALSE}
quiz(caption = 'Check Your Results',
     question("Does your boxplot suggest the presence of any outliers in your data?",
              answer('Yes', correct = T),
              answer('No'),
              message = "The dot just past the upper whisker of the box reflecting Low Self-Enhancement reflects an outlier."),
     question("Does your dot-and-error plot suggest the presence of an interaction between SEcategory and ParentalPressure on AntisocialBehaviour?",
              answer('Yes', correct = T),
              answer('No'),
              message = "The effect of Self-Enhancement on AntisocialBehaviour is different across levels of Parental Pressure, so it is likely that there is an interaction effect."))
