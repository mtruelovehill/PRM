### This Week's Key Topics

+ When to use Factorial ANOVA

+ What is an interaction?

+ Interpreting and reporting the results of Factorial ANOVA

+ Power Analyses with Factorial ANOVAs

---
### Recap from last week

+ ANOVAs can be used to compare more than two means. 

  + One-Way ANOVA and Repeated-Measures ANOVA test for differences in the dependent variable between 3 or more levels of a single independent variable. 
  
  + **Factorial (Multiway) ANOVA** tests for differences in the dependent variable across &lt;b&gt;multiple&lt;/b&gt; independent variables

+ A Factorial ANOVA requires:

  + A continuous dependent variable
  
  + 2 or more categorical independent variables (with at least 2 levels each)

---
### Factorial ANOVA

+ Compares the mean of the dependent variable across multiple levels of multiple independent variable

+ When using factorial ANOVA, you can test for both main effects and interactions

  + When multiple independent variables are included in the model, the **main effects** capture the effect of each independent variable, while holding the other independent variable(s) constant.
  
  + The **interaction** captures the how the effect of one independent variable on the dependent variable *changes* across levels of the other independent variable
  
  + This is also known as **moderation**, as the effect between two variables is being moderated by a third.

## Questions?

---
### Hypotheses

+ Because we have multiple independent variables, we often have multiple hypotheses.

  + Hypotheses about main effects
  
  + Hypothesis about interaction

+ A key consideration when working with tests that produce multiple results is to be sure your research aims and hypotheses align with what your focus in the results and discussion. 

---
### Example Scenario

.pull-left[
+ A researcher is interested in how pet ownership and personality affect subjective well-being.

+ They collect the following data from participants:
  + Type of pet (dog/cat/other/none)
  + Personality type (introvert/extrovert)
  + Subjective well-being
]

.pull-right[

![](Week06_ANOVAII_lecture_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.svg)&lt;!-- --&gt;


]

--

+ There 3 possible research questions that could be tested:

  + Is there an effect of pet ownership on subjective well-being?
  
  + Is there an effect of personality type (introvert vs extrovert) on subjective well being?
  
  + Does the effect of pet ownership on subjective well-being change across personality types?

** Test Your Understanding:** Which of the above questions reference a main effect and which reference an interaction?

---
### The Logic Behind Factorial ANOVA

+ Recall from last week that ANOVAs evaluate two features in our data:

  + Variance in the dependent variable explained by the independent variable ( `\(SS_{model}\)`)
  
  + Variance in the dependent variable *not* explained by the independent variable ( `\(SS_{residual}\)`)

--

+ With a Factorial ANOVA, the only difference is that the variance explained by the IV is broken down depending on the number of Independent Variables:

### The Logic Behind Factorial ANOVA

.pull-left[
Recall from last week that `\(SS_{model}\)` is calculated as the distance between the means of each group and the grand mean. 

When there is one IV with 3 groups, this distance is computed between the grand mean and each individual within each of the groups:

![](Week06_ANOVAII_lecture_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.svg)&lt;!-- --&gt;

]

--

.pull-right[
When there are multiple IVs, `\(SS_{model}\)` is still calculated as the distance between the means of each group and the grand mean. 

With 2 IVs (one with 2 levels and one with 3), there are 6 possible groups, so `\(SS_{model}\)` is computed from these:

![](Week06_ANOVAII_lecture_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.svg)&lt;!-- --&gt;

]

---
### The `\(F\)` distribution

.pull-left[
+ The `\(F\)`-distribution is the null distribution against which our calculated `\(F\)`-statistic is compared. 

+ Like the `\(t\)` distribution, the shape of the `\(F\)`-distribution depends on the degrees of freedom in our data.

+ Values of 0 or 1 are most common in the null distribution, with values farther from than 1 increasingly less likely.

+ Note that `\(F\)` will never be less than 0. 

]

.pull-right[

![](Week06_ANOVAII_lecture_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.svg)&lt;!-- --&gt;

]

---
### Putting it all together

.pull-left[
Basically:

1) Calculate your `\(F\)`-statistic

2) Identify the proper null distribution using `\(df_{model}\)` and `\(df_{residual}\)`

3) Using this distribution, compute the probability of getting an `\(F\)`-statistic at least as extreme as yours


]

]

---
### Posthoc Tests

+ After determining the presence of an overall effect, you can conduct posthoc tests to look for specific effects between groups.

+ Involves running separate tests on each possible comparison

--

+ But what about inflated Type I error risk??

--

+ First, these are only conducted if the presence of an overall effect is detected.

+ Second, `\(p\)`-values are corrected so that the overall Type I error rate across all tests is still equal to the `\(\alpha\)` threshold

### Questions?

---

### Conducting an ANOVA

1. State your hypothesis

2. Conduct a power analysis

3. Check your data (visualisations/descriptives)

4. Check assumptions

5. Run the test

6. Calculate the effect size/confidence intervals

7. Interpret results

8. Report

---
### State Your Hypotheses

+ `\(H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 =...\mu_n\)`

+ `\(H_1:\)` at least one `\(\mu\)` is different from the other `\(\mu\)`s

+ Note that the ANOVA distribution only has one tail, due to the nature of the `\(F\)`-statistic calculation (a ratio cannot be less than 0)

+ However, `\(H_1\)` is still nondirectional
  + ANOVA doesn't tell you the direction of group differences, just that (at least) one exists.

### State Your Hypotheses

]

---
### Assumptions of ANOVA

+ **Normality:** Dependent data should be normally distributed *within groups*

--
  
+ **Independence:** Observations/individuals should be sampled independently

--

+ **Homogeneity of Variance:** Equal variance between each group/category

  + This is called sphericity in the case of repeated-measures ANOVA, but it's the same general idea. 

---

### Effect size - `\(\eta^2\)`

`$$\eta^2 = \frac{SS_{model}}{SS_{total}}$$`

+ `\(\eta^2\)` is the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable

+ Values range from 0 to 1

+ When you have multiple variables, you instead use `\(\eta^2_p\)`, which is the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable *while controlling for the other variables in the model*. 



---

### Interpretation of `\(\eta^2\)`


| Strength | Magnitude of `\(\eta^2\)` |
|:--------:|:-------------------------:|
| Weak     | `\(\leq\)` .01                |
| Moderate | `\(\approx\)` .06             |
| Strong   | `\(\geq\)` .14                |

### Questions?

### Running a One-way ANOVA

**Step 1: State Your Hypotheses**

**Research Question:** Does the type of auditory stimulus an infant is exposed to have an effect on their affect?

**Independent Variable:** Auditory Stimulus (3 levels: Infant-directed Speech; Adult-directed Speech; Infant-directed Singing)

**Dependent Variable:** Time until distressed

.pull-left[.center[&lt;span style = "color: #18778C"&gt; Null Hypothesis &lt;/span&gt;
`$$\mu_{IDspeech} = \mu_{ADspeech} = \mu_{IDsinging}$$`
]]

.pull-right[.center[&lt;span style = "color: #18778C"&gt; Alternative Hypothesis &lt;/span&gt;

At least one `\(\mu \neq\)` the other `\(\mu\)`s

]]


---
### Running a One-way ANOVA

**Step 2: Conduct a Power Analysis**

+ [WebPower](https://webpower.psychstat.org/wiki/models/index)

+ Let's check the sample required to achieve 80% power to detect a moderate effect ( `\(eta^2\)` = .06) with `\(\alpha\)` = .05.

+ Although we use `\(\eta^2\)`, Webpower requires the effect size to be entered as `\(f\)`, so you'll need to convert it using the following formula:

`$$f = \sqrt{\frac{\eta^2}{1-\eta^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{.06}{1-.06}} = .25$$`

---
### Running a One-way ANOVA

**Step 3: Check your data**

+ Compute descriptive statistics

+ Look at relevant plots
  
--

+ Let's do this in SPSS using [these data](https://mtruelovehill.github.io/PRM/Data/babyDat.sav).


---
### Running a One-way ANOVA

**Step 4: Check Assumptions**

+ Normality
  
  + Have a look at the histograms &amp; QQ-plots

+ Independence of Observations
 
  + Consider study design

+ Homogeneity of Variance
 
  + Check the results of Levene's Test

### Running a One-way ANOVA

**Step 5: Run the test**

**Step 6: Calculate the effect size**

**Step 7: Interpret results**

Let's continue in SPSS...

### Running a One-way ANOVA

**Step 8: Report**

+ alpha threshold 

+ Type of test conducted

+ Variables tested

+ Descriptive data

+ Test results:
  + Test statistic ( `\(t\)`)
  + Degrees of freedom
  + `\(p\)`-value
  + Effect sizes and/or confidence intervals

+ Brief interpretation (NO DISCUSSION)



---
### Running a One-way ANOVA

**Step 8: Report**

We conducted a **One-Way ANOVA** to determine the effect of &lt;span style = "color:#9AD079"&gt; &lt;b&gt; auditory stimulus &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; on &lt;span style = "color:#9AD079"&gt; &lt;b&gt; an infant's affect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. The `\(\alpha\)` threshold was set at .05 for all analyses. There was a significant effect of stimulus, &lt;span style = "color:#18778C"&gt;&lt;b&gt; `\(F\)`(2, 57) = 5.99, `\(p\)` = .004, `\(eta^2\)` = .174, 95% CI = [.02, .33] &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Posthoc Tukey's tests indicated that infants listening to infant-directed singing displayed a positive or neutral affect significantly longer &lt;span style = "color:#19424C"&gt;&lt;b&gt; ($M$ = 6.32, `\(SD\)` = 2.27)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; than infants listening to adult-directed speech &lt;span style = "color:#19424C"&gt;&lt;b&gt; ($M$ = 4.36, `\(SD\)` = 1.55)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, `\(p\)` = .005, or infants listening to infant-directed speech &lt;span style = "color:#19424C"&gt;&lt;b&gt;( `\(M\)` = 4.78, `\(SD\)` = 1.77)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, `\(p\)` = .033. There was no significant difference in time of distress in infants listening to adult-directed speech and those listening to infant-directed speech, `\(p\)` = .762.

### Running a Repeated-measures ANOVA

**Step 1: State Your Hypotheses**

Does the presence of a family member have an effect on infant's affect?

.pull-left[.center[&lt;span style = "color: #18778C"&gt; Null Hypothesis &lt;/span&gt;
`$$\mu_{parentAbsent} = \mu_{siblingPresent} = \mu_{parentPresent}$$`

### Running a Repeated-measures ANOVA

**Step 4: Check Assumptions**

.pull-left[


+ Normality of difference scores
  
  + Have a look at the histograms &amp; QQ-plots
  + Check skewness and kurtosis values
  + May also run statistical tests of normality...but this is not recommended

+ Independence (of participants rather than observations)

  + Consider study design
  
+ Sphericity
  
  + Check Mauchly's test

### Running a Repeated-measures ANOVA

**Step 8: Report**

We conducted a **Repeated-measures ANOVA** to determine the effect of &lt;span style = "color:#9AD079"&gt; &lt;b&gt; familial presence  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; on &lt;span style = "color:#9AD079"&gt; &lt;b&gt;infant affect &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. There was a significant effect of familial presence, &lt;span style = "color:#18778C"&gt;&lt;b&gt; `\(F\)`(1.83, 107.99) = 42.40, `\(p\)` &lt; .001, `\(\eta^2_p\)` = 0.42 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Mean comparisons with Bonferroni corrections indicated that infants became distressed more quickly when no family members were present &lt;span style = "color:#19424C"&gt;&lt;b&gt; ( `\(M\)` = 3.85, `\(SD\)` = 2.05)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; than when a sibling was present &lt;span style = "color:#19424C"&gt;&lt;b&gt;( `\(M\)` = 5.04, `\(SD\)` = 1.79)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, `\(p\)` &lt; .001, and when a parent was present &lt;span style = "color:#19424C"&gt;&lt;b&gt;( `\(M\)` = 7.03, `\(SD\)` = 2.05)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, `\(p\)` &lt; .001. Infants retained a positive or neutral affect for longer when a parent was present than when a sibling was present, `\(p\)` &lt; .001.
