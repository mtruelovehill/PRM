## This Week's Key Topics

+ The Null Distribution

+ `\(\alpha\)`

+ `\(p\)`-Values


---
## Hypotheses

+ **Null Hypothesis ( `\(H_0\)` ):** There is no difference, effect, or association between variables; any experimentally observed difference is due to chance

+ **Alternative Hypothesis ( `\(H_1\)` ):** There is a relationship or association between variables

--

+ When conducting null-hypothesis statistic testing, we attempt to determine which action is correct:
  + Reject `\(H_0\)`
  + Fail to reject `\(H_0\)`

--

+ The burden of proof is on `\(H_1\)`

  + Assume `\(H_0\)` is accurate until there is sufficient evidence that it is not
  
---
## Assessing Evidence


+ In psychology, we rely on empirical evidence to draw conclusions

  + In other words, we gather data and look for consistent patterns within the data that support (or refute) our ideas

--
  
+ Statistical testing allows us to evaluate the strength of the evidence against `\(H_0\)`

--

  + We use our observations to calculate a statistical value, then compute the likelihood of this value occurring under the constraints of `\(H_0\)`
  
--
  
  + We use this **probability** to make a decision about `\(H_0\)`:
      + If the observed value is unlikely to occur under `\(H_0\)`, we consider this sufficient evidence to reject it
      + If the observed value is likely to occur under `\(H_0\)`, we don't reject `\(H_0\)`, because we haven't gathered sufficient evidence against it.


---
## Frequency vs Probability Distributions

+ Recall that a frequency distribution shows the frequency of each possible observation:

## Probability Distributions

+ A probability distribution shows the probability of randomly selecting an observation (or range) from the data:

## Continuous Probability Distributions

+ Why does this matter?

--

+ The statistical tests we will be using work by testing the probability of our results given the null hypothesis

  + In other words, if the null hypothesis is true, how likely is it that we would get results at least as extreme as ours?

+ If our results are unusual enough, we reject the null hypothesis.

## Questions?

---
## Testing Against the Null Hypothesis

+ In order to make a decision whether our data/values are unusual, we need to have an understanding of what values we might expect to see if the null hypothesis were true.

--

&gt; **Test Your Understanding:** Given the following distributions, do you think a value of 20 would be unusual?

]



???

+ A value of 20 tells us nothing without context


---
## Null Distributions

+ Many inferential statistical tests evaluate significance by comparing results to a predefined probability distribution known as the **null distribution**

+ The null distribution is the probability distribution of a statistic **given that the null hypothesis is true**. 

+ Each statistical test is associated with a separate null distribution

## Comparing Results to Null Distribution

+ When you run a statistical test, you:

  1. Compute a test statistic based on your data
  
  2. Calculate the probability of obtaining this statistic if the null were true
  
  3. Use this probability to make a decision whether to reject the null hypothesis.

## `\(p\)` - values

.pull-left[
+ The `\(p\)`-value is the **probability** of obtaining data at least as extreme as ours, given that the null hypothesis is true.

+ It is not:
  + The likelihood that the null hypothesis is true.
  + The likelihood that our hypothesis is false

+ It provides insight into the strength of our evidence against the null hypothesis. 

+ If `\(p\)`-value passes a specific threshold, we consider our results to be **significant**, and `\(H_0\)` is rejected.

---

## `\(\alpha\)`

+ The 'threshold' for significance is known as alpha, `\(\alpha\)`

+ If the `\(p\)`-value is less than the predetermined `\(\alpha\)` threshold, `\(H_0\)` is rejected

+ But what, exactly, does `\(\alpha\)` reflect?

---
## Errors

+ Whether the decision is made to reject or fail to reject `\(H_0\)`, you may be making an error.

+ Basically, what you find in your sample isn't actually what is true of the population.

--

+ Two types of errors:

  + **Type I Error:** You reject the `\(H_0\)` when it is actually true (i.e. you suggest there is an effect or an association when there really isn't)
  
  + **Type II Error:** You fail to reject the `\(H_0\)` when you actually should (i.e. you don't find an effect or association that actually exists)

---
## `\(\alpha\)`

+ `\(\alpha\)` reflects the probability of making a Type I error

+ It is the likelihood of rejecting `\(H_0\)` when it is actually true.
  
+ You choose your desired `\(\alpha\)` value before you run any analyses. 

  + The most commonly used `\(\alpha\)` is .05, but may sometimes be set at .01 or .001.
  
  + If `\(\alpha\)` is set at .05, it means there is a 5% risk of rejecting `\(H_0\)` when it shouldn't be.

## Questions?

## One-Tailed vs Two-Tailed Tests

.pull-left[

+ When evaluating evidence against `\(H_0\)`, our threshold for what values are considered to be *extreme* depends on whether we're running a one-tailed or two-tailed test.

## One-Tailed vs Two-Tailed Tests

.pull-left[

+ When evaluating evidence against `\(H_0\)`, our threshold for what values are considered to be *extreme* depends on whether we're running a one-tailed or two-tailed test.

+ With a **one-tailed test**, we're only interested in values in a single tail of a distribution

  + If `\(\alpha\)` is set at .05, we check that our observation is in the highest 5% of values *or* the lowest 5% of values

+ When evaluating evidence against `\(H_0\)`, our threshold for what values are considered to be *extreme* depends on whether we're running a one-tailed or two-tailed test.

+ With a **two-tailed test**, we're interested in values in both tails of a distribution

  + If `\(\alpha\)` is set at .05, we check that our observation is in the *most extreme* 5% of values, whether they are higher or lower
  
  + 5% is split equally between the two tails

---
## Putting it Together

+ When we run a statistical test, our results are compared against the null distribution, which is the probability of the results given the null hypothesis is true.

+ If the probability of our outcome (the `\(p\)`-value) is less than the `\(\alpha\)` threshold, it means the outcome falls into the range that we've designated as extreme.

+ Because it's really unlikely that these results would occur if the null hypothesis were true, we consider this to be sufficient evidence against the null hypothesis, and we reject it.
