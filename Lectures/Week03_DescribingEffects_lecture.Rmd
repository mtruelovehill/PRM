## This Week's Key Topics

+ Effect Sizes

+ Standard Error

+ Confidence Intervals

+ Power

---
## Recap from Last Week
+ When we run a statistical test, we compare our results against the null distribution, which provides the probability of the statistical value given the null hypothesis is true.

+ If the probability (the $p$-value) associated with our outcome is less than the predefined $\alpha$, it means the outcome falls into the range that we've designated as extreme.

+ Because it's really unlikely that this outcome would occur if $H_0$ were true, we consider this sufficient evidence against $H_0$, and we reject it.



---
## Effect Size

+ On it's own, a $p$-value is not sufficiently descriptive of the results.

???

Think about practical significance - a pharmaceutical company tests the effect of their new vitamin and finds that it significantly decreases the amount of time someone is sick over the course of a year. SIGNIFICANCE! But wait...it only decreases the amount of sick days by a single day. EFFECT SIZE. Do they really want to spend an immense amount of money for a single day's improvement?

---
## Effect Size

+ $p$-value: Is the effect significant?

+ Effect Size: Is the effect meaningful?

+ **Both** should be reported

--

+ Many measures of effect size exist (e.g. $d$, $\eta^2$, $r$)

+ Usually, effect sizes are standardised rather than representing the raw difference between values
  
  + This means that comparisons can be made across different variables

---
## Drawing Conclusions

Given $\alpha$ = .05, consider the following results:

.pull-left[

1. $p$ < .001, effect size = large

2. $p$ = .341, effect size = large

3. $p$ = .002, effect size = small

4. $p$ = .512, effect size = small

]

--

.pull-right[

+ Is the result **significant?**

+ Is it **meaningful?**

## Questions?

---
## Confidence Intervals

+ A **confidence interval** defines a plausible range of values for the population parameter of interest. 

  + (Remember, we don't actually know the population parameter; we're trying to estimate this using our sample's data)

+ The wider the interval, the more confident we can be that the interval captures the true population value.

  + (Remember, we don't actually know the population parameter; we're trying to estimate this using our sample's data)

+ The wider the interval, the more confident we can be that the interval captures the true population value.

+ To estimate the confidence interval, we need:

  + To define a confidence level
  + The standard error
  
---
## Confidence Level

+ The **confidence level** refers to the percentage of times confidence intervals would be expected to contain the true population parameter across repeated samples.

+ The typical confidence level used is **95%**

  + If we were to take 100 samples and calculate a 95% CI on each of them, ~95 of those intervals would contain the true population parameter.


???

+ What are we 95% confident in?

  + We are 95% confident that our interval contains the true population mean.
  
  + The 95% probability comes from the long-run frequencies of our intervals.

---
## Standard Error

+ The **standard error** gives a sense of how different $\bar{x}$ is likely to be from $\mu$

+ It helps you to evaluate how well your sample reflects the population

+ A smaller standard error suggests the estimate is likely to be closer to the true population parameter

Why would we calculate this? Who has the time and resources to collect lots of different samples???

Don't worry, brilliant statisticians have figured out how you can estimate this value from a single sample.

## Power

+ Recall last week's discussion about Type I & Type II error

+ The $\alpha$ threshold reflects a study's risk of a Type I error

--

+ Similarly, we have to make a decision about how much we want to risk making a **Type II error** 

  + The probability of making a Type II error is known as $\beta$
  
+ An analysis's power reflects how likely it is that an effect will be detected *if it exists*
  
  + AKA, 1 - $\beta$

---

## Power
  
+ A conventional value for power is .8 (80% power)

+ This means there is a 20% chance of making a Type II error

+ When designing a study, a power analysis should be conducted to ensure that this power threshold will be reached given the sample constraints of the study

  + The type of power analysis you use will depend upon the statistical test you plan to perform

## Power

+ There are typically four numbers that go into a power analysis. If you have 3 of these numbers, you can solve for the fourth:

  + $\alpha$
  + Effect Size
  + $n$
  + Power

> **Test Your Understanding:** How do you think each of these values affects your ability to detect an effect?

## Types of Power Analyses

+ In most a priori power analyses, you'll want to calculate the **sample** required to get 80% power for a specific effect size and $\alpha$ value.

+ However, if you already have a set sample (e.g. a secondary data analysis), you might want to compute the **effect size** that it can detect, given certain $\alpha$ and power thresholds.

+ In this course, we'll be using [WebPower](https://webpower.psychstat.org/wiki/models/index) to conduct power analysis.
