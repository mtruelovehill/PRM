### This Week's Key Topics

+ Types of ANOVAs and their assumptions

+ Interpreting and reporting the results of ANOVA

+ Computing and interpreting effect sizes for ANOVA

+ Conducting a power analysis for ANOVA

---
### Moving on from `\(t\)`-tests

MONICA - CHECK THIS...not sure if I currently feel okay about it, because we also need to set up the idea of post-hocs. Maybe compare it to using a shoe to hammer a nail?

+ `\(t\)`-tests allow for the comparison of two means...what if we need to compare more than two?

+ 'We can just run more `\(t\)`-tests'...

--

+ **NO.**

--

+ *Type I Errors:* rejecting the null when it is actually true.

+ `\(\alpha\)` reflects our Type I error rate, or the probability of rejecting the null given that it is true.

--

+ When we run a statistical test, we have a Type I error probability equal to `\(\alpha\)` (usually .05, or 5%). This probability is not across ALL tests, but within each test. 

+ When you run multiple tests when a single test would do, you're inflating the risk of making a Type I error.

---
### Types of ANOVA

+ ANOVAs can be used to compare more than two means. 

  + **One-Way ANOVA** test for differences between 3 or more independent means
  
  + **Repeated-Measures ANOVA** test for differences in a single sample at 3 or more timepoints or conditions
  
  + **Multiway ANOVA** tests for differences between multiple means across multiple independent variables

--

+ Because of this, all ANOVAs require:

  + A continuous dependent variable
  
  + At least one categorical independent variable with three or more levels

---
### One-Way ANOVA

+ Compare the mean of the dependent variable across multiple levels of a single independent variable

+ Each level of the independent variable reflects an independent sample

+ CHECK WHETHER THIS COULD BE PHRASED BETTER Tests whether there is a difference between at least one pair of levels

--

+ **Example research questions:** [CHANGE THESE TO MATCH ANOVA]

  + Are speeds along Road A significantly higher than the speed limit?
  
  + Do a beauty product's results last longer than 3 months?

---
### Repeated-Measures ANOVA

+ Compare the mean of the dependent variable across multiple levels of a single independent variable

+ Each member of the sample provided data for all levels of the independent variable

+ CHECK WHETHER THIS COULD BE PHRASED BETTER Tests whether there is a difference between at least one pair of levels

--

+ **Example research questions:** [CHANGE THESE TO MATCH ANOVA]

  + Are there differences in symptoms between the treatment group and the group that received a placebo?
  
  + Do inmates who are put in solitary confinement exhibit more aggressive behaviour than those who are not?
  
  + Are there differences in TBI rate between boxers and Muay Thai fighters?
  

---
### ANOVA

+ Running an ANOVA involves:

  + Computing `\(F\)`
  
  + Calculating the probability of obtaining our value of `\(F\)` if the null were true

  + Using this probability to make a decision whether to reject the null hypothesis

### The Logic Behind ANOVA


`$$F = \frac{MS_{model}}{MS_{residual}}$$`

+ ANOVAs produce an `\(F\)`-statistic that is the ratio of the variation in the DV explained by our IV(s) and the variation explained by other unmeasured factors.


+ `\(MS_{model} = \frac{SS_{model}}{df_{model}}\)` - reflects the variation in DV explained by the IV

  + AKA `\(MS_{between}\)` or `\(MS_{treatment}\)`

+ `\(MS_{residual} = \frac{SS_{residual}}{df_{residual}}\)` - reflects the variation in DV unexplained by IV

  + AKA `\(MS_{within}\)` or `\(MS_{error}\)`

--

+ Recall the sum of squared deviations from the [standard deviation calculation in Week 1](https://mtruelovehill.github.io/PRM/Lectures/Week01_ExploringData_Lecture.html#37). 

+ Here, the sums of squares (SS) is once again referring to a sum of squared distances between values.

### The `\(F\)` distribution

.pull-left[
+ The `\(F\)`-distribution is the null distribution against which our calculated `\(F\)`-statistic is compared. 

+ Like the `\(t\)` distribution, the shape of the `\(F\)`-distribution depends on the degrees of freedom in our data.

+ Values of 0 or 1 are most common in the null distribution, with values farther from than 1 increasingly less likely.

+ Note that `\(F\)` will never be less than 0.

### Putting it all together

.pull-left[
Basically:

1) Calculate your `\(F\)`-statistic

2) Identify the proper null distribution using `\(df_{model}\)` and `\(df_{residual}\)`

3) Using this distribution, compute the probability of getting an `\(F\)`-statistic at least as extreme as yours

### Questions?

### Conducting an ANOVA

1. State your hypothesis

2. Conduct a power analysis

3. Check your data (visualisations/descriptives)

4. Check assumptions

5. Run the test

6. Calculate the effect size/confidence intervals

7. Interpret results

8. Report

---
### State Your Hypotheses

+ `\(H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 =...\mu_n\)`

+ `\(H_1:\)` at least one `\(\mu\)` is different from the other `\(\mu\)`s

+ Note that the ANOVA distribution only has one tail, due to the nature of the `\(F\)`-statistic calculation (a ratio cannot be less than 0)

+ However, `\(H_1\)` is still nondirectional
  + ANOVA doesn't tell you the direction of group differences, just that (at least) one exists.

]

---
### Assumptions of ANOVA

+ **Normality:** Dependent data should be normally distributed *within groups*

--
  
+ **Independence:** Observations/individuals should be sampled independently

--

+ **Homogeneity of Variance:** Equal variance between each group/category

  + This is called sphericity in the case of repeated-measures ANOVA, but it's the same general idea. 

---

### Effect size - `\(\eta^2\)`

`$$\eta^2 = \frac{SS_{model}}{SS_{total}}$$`

+ `\(\eta^2\)` is the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable

+ Values range from 0 to 1

+ When you have multiple variables, you instead use `\(\eta^2_p\)`, which is the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable *while controlling for the other variables in the model*.

### Questions?

### Running a One-way ANOVA

**Step 1: State Your Hypotheses**

**Research Question:** Does the type of auditory stimulus an infant is exposed to have an effect on their affect?

**Independent Variable:** Auditory Stimulus (3 levels: Infant-directed Speech; Adult-directed Speech; Infant-directed Singing)

**Dependent Variable:** Time until distressed

.pull-left[.center[&lt;span style = "color: #18778C"&gt; Null Hypothesis &lt;/span&gt;]
`$$H_0:  \mu_{IDspeech} = \mu_{ADspeech} = \mu_{IDsinging}$$`
]

.pull-right[.center[&lt;span style = "color: #18778C"&gt; Alternative Hypothesis &lt;/span&gt;]

`$$H_1:$$` At least one `\(\mu \neq\)` the other `\(\mu\)`s

]


---
### Running a One-way ANOVA

**Step 2: Conduct a Power Analysis**

+ [WebPower](https://webpower.psychstat.org/wiki/models/index)

+ Let's check the sample required to achieve 80% power to detect a moderate effect ( `\(eta^2\)` = .06) with `\(\alpha\)` = .05.

+ Although we use `\(\eta^2\)`, Webpower requires the effect size to be entered as `\(f\)`, so you'll need to convert it using the following formula:

`$$f = \sqrt{\frac{\eta^2}{1-\eta^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{.06}{1-.06}} = .25$$`

---
## Running a One-way ANOVA

**Step 3: Check your data**

+ Compute descriptive statistics

+ Look at relevant plots
  
--

+ Let's do this in SPSS using [these data](https://mtruelovehill.github.io/PRM/Data/babyDat.sav).


---
## Running a One-way ANOVA

**Step 4: Check Assumptions**

+ Normality
  
  + Have a look at the histograms &amp; QQ-plots

+ Independence of Observations
 
  + Consider study design

+ Homogeneity of Variance
 
  + Check the results of Levene's Test

## Running a One-way ANOVA

**Step 5: Run the test**

**Step 6: Calculate the effect size**

**Step 7: Interpret results**

Let's continue in SPSS...

  + Degrees of freedom
  + `\(p\)`-value

### Running a One-way ANOVA

**Step 8: Report**

We conducted a **One-Way ANOVA** to determine the effect of &lt;span style = "color:#9AD079"&gt; &lt;b&gt; auditory stimulus &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; on &lt;span style = "color:#9AD079"&gt; &lt;b&gt; an infant's affect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. The `\(\alpha\)` threshold was set at .05 for all analyses. There was a significant effect of stimulus, &lt;span style = "color:#18778C"&gt;&lt;b&gt; `\(F\)`(2, 57) = 5.99, `\(p\)` = .004, `\(eta^2\)` = .174, 95% CI = [.02, .33] &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Posthoc Tukey's tests indicated that infants listening to infant-directed singing displayed a positive or neutral affect significantly longer &lt;span style = "color:#19424C"&gt;&lt;b&gt; ($M$ = 6.32, `\(SD\)` = 2.27)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; than infants listening to adult-directed speech &lt;span style = "color:#19424C"&gt;&lt;b&gt; ($M$ = 4.36, `\(SD\)` = 1.55)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, `\(p\)` = .005, or infants listening to infant-directed speech &lt;span style = "color:#19424C"&gt;&lt;b&gt;( `\(M\)` = 4.78, `\(SD\)` = 1.77)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, `\(p\)` = .033. There was no significant difference in time of distress in infants listening to adult-directed speech and those listening to infant-directed speech, `\(p\)` = .762.
