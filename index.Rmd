## Course Description

This option is a core course for the MSc in Psychology of Mental Health (Conversion) at the University of Edinburgh. This course aims to provide students with both a theoretical and practical understanding of the use of statistics in psychology. It will familiarise students with both quantitative and qualitative statistical methods, with a primary focus on quantitative methods. Over the course, lectures will cover topics such as t-tests, ANOVA, regression, and thematic analysis, among others. Additionally, students will attend labs during which they gain hands-on practice implementing the content covered in lectures.
