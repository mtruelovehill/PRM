## Intro to Today's Lab

During today's lab, you'll be working through the formative assessment. This assessment does not contribute to your course mark. It serves only as a check-in so that you are more aware of what areas you're confident in, and which areas you may need to revise further. The tutors will be available to clarify any feedback or provide further feedback as necessary. Good luck!
