## Why????

+ Psychology is a science....

--

+ with a lot of uncertainty

--

+ To answer our research questions, we rely on empirical evidence 

+ We take measurements that allow us to make systematic observations of our construct of interest, then use these observations to draw conclusions

+ In other words, we gather data and look for consistent patterns within the data that support (or refute) our ideas

+ But how do we decide what is *consistent enough*?

---

## Research process

&lt;img src="images/ResearchProcess.png" width="2411" /&gt;

---
exclude: true
## The truth is out there.

---
## From sample to population

+ In statistics, we often refer to samples and populations
  
  + **Population:** The entire group about whom you're making inferences
  
  + **Sample:** The subset of the population from whom you will collect data to make these inferences
  
+ We typically use **sample statistics**, or **point-estimates** to make inferences about **population parameters**

---
## Hypotheses

+ **Null Hypothesis ( `\(H_0\)` ):** There is no difference or effect, and any experimentally observed difference is due to chance

+ **Alternative Hypothesis ( `\(H_1\)` ):** There is a relationship or association between variables

+ The burden of proof is on `\(H_1\)`

  + Assume `\(H_0\)` is accurate until there is sufficient evidence that it is not
  
  + Tests of significance assess strength of the evidence against `\(H_0\)`

---
## Visualising your data: Frequency Distributions

+ Frequency distributions allow you to visualise how often each observation occurs

+ The type of frequency distribution you should use depends on the type of data you have:

## Describing your data: Central Tendancy

+ What is the middle-ish point of your data?

+ Can estimate in 3 ways:
  + **Mean**
  + **Median**
  + **Mode**

## Central Tendancy: Mean

.pull-left[


**The mathematical notation:**

`$$\bar{x} = \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i}{n}$$`
+ Where:
    + `\(n\)` = total number of values in the data
    + `\(x_i\)` = an individual value in the data
    + `\(\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n}\)` = sum all values between 1 ( `\(i=1\)` ) and `\(n\)`

## Central Tendancy: Mean

+ Can be used with _continuous/numeric_ data (i.e. interval and ratio data)

+ Shouldn't be used with nominal data, and it's best not used with ordinal data, even though they may be coded as numeric values


--


+ Say you have the following scale:

.pull-left[


| Scale  | Rate your understanding of the lecture     |
|--------|--------------------------------------------|
|    1   | I'm completely lost.                       |
|    2   | I'm a bit confused.                        |
|    3   | I understand about half of it.             |
|    4   | It's starting to come together.            |
|    5   | Everything is perfectly clear.             |

+ The value in the exact center of a range

+ Can be used with ordinal, ratio, or interval data

`\(x = \{10, 2, 5, 3, 2, 0, 12\}\)`

`\(y = \{3, 7, 1, 20, 14, 25\}\)`


`\(1, 3, \color{#4CA384}{7, 14,} 20, 25\)`


`\(\frac{7+14}{2} = 10.5\)`


**Median `\(y\)` = 10.5**
]



]


---
## Central Tendancy: Mode

.pull-left[
+ The value that appears most frequently in a range

+ Can be used with all types of data, although may be less descriptive of continuous data depending on the precision of the measurement

+ Data may be bimodal or multimodal

+ It allows you to get a sense of variation in your data, excluding the most extreme values

+ This metric depends on the order of the values in the data, so note that the plot has been reordered based on Age. 

+ **NOTE:** The IQR is a key component of a boxplot, which we will return to later in the course

## Why n-1?

Probably a wider spread in the population than what we are accounting for in our small sample

As the sample grows larger, the variance estimated using n or n-1 grows more similar

+ We can also use probability distributions to compute the probability of value beyond a specific point on the distribution.

+ Imagine we have a range of observations whose values fall between 8 and 32 that are distributed as pictured.

+ Let's say we randomly select an observation from our dataset.

+ What is the likelihood our randomly selected observation is at least 25?

+ ~95% of our observations are less than 25. This means we only have about a 5% chance of randomly selecting an observation of at least 25.

## Probability Distributions

+ Why does this matter?

--

+ Many of the statistical tests we will learn about in this course all involve testing the probability of a specific value of a test statistic, given that `\(H_0\)` is true. 

+ In other words, if `\(H_0\)` is true, how likely is it that we would get results at least as extreme as ours?

+ If the value is unusual enough (i.e., if it is highly unlikely we would see the value if the null is true), we reject `\(H_0\)`

## The normal distribution

+ A probability distribution where values around the mean are most common, and values further from the mean are increasingly less common.

+ AKA the bell curve, a Gaussian distribution

## Assessing Normality in Data

+ Can visually assess histograms

+ Can also assess using statistical tests:

  + For samples &lt; 50, could use the *Shapiro-Wilk Test*

  + For samples &gt; 50, could use the *Kolmogorov–Smirnov Test*

  + Significant results on these tests indicate that normality has been violated

+ Can also check the skewness and kurtosis values
  + Values further from 0 indicate greater levels of skewness or kurtosis
