### This Week's Key Topics

+ When to use Factorial ANOVA

+ What is an interaction?

+ Interpreting and reporting the results of Factorial ANOVA

+ Power Analyses with Factorial ANOVAs

---
### Recap from last week

+ ANOVAs can be used to compare more than two means. 

  + One-Way ANOVA tests for differences in the dependent variable between 3 or more levels of a single independent variable. 
  
  + **Factorial (Multiway) ANOVA** tests for differences in the dependent variable across &lt;b&gt;multiple&lt;/b&gt; independent variables

+ A Factorial ANOVA requires:

  + A continuous dependent variable
  
  + 2 or more categorical independent variables (with at least 2 levels each)

---
### Factorial ANOVA

+ Factorial ANOVA tests for differences in the dependent variable across &lt;b&gt;multiple&lt;/b&gt; independent variables

  + Between-Subjects Factorial ANOVA - all IVs are between-subjects
  
  + Within-Subjects Factorial ANOVA - all IVs are within-subjects
  
  + Mixed Factorial ANOVA - both between- and within-subjects IVs are included in the analysis


---
### Factorial ANOVA

+ Compares the mean of the dependent variable across multiple levels of multiple independent variable

+ When using factorial ANOVA, you can test for both main effects and interactions

  + When multiple independent variables are included in the model, the **main effects** capture the effect of each independent variable, while holding the other independent variable(s) constant.
  
  + The **interaction** captures the how the effect of one independent variable on the dependent variable *changes* across levels of the other independent variable
  
  + This is also known as **moderation**, as the effect between two variables is being moderated by a third.

## Questions?

---
### Hypotheses

+ Because we have multiple independent variables, we often have multiple hypotheses.

  + Hypotheses about main effects
  
  + Hypothesis about interaction

+ A key consideration when working with tests that produce multiple results is to be sure your research aims and hypotheses align with what your focus in the results and discussion. 

---
### Example Scenario

.pull-left[
+ A researcher is interested in how pet ownership and personality affect subjective well-being.

+ **Independent Variables:**
  + Type of Pet (dog/cat/none)
  + Personality Type (introvert/extrovert)

+ **Dependent Variable:**
  + Subjective Well-being Scores
]

.pull-right[

![](Week06_ANOVAII_lecture_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.svg)&lt;!-- --&gt;


]

---
### Example Scenario

+ The researcher wants to test for 3 possible effects:

  + Is there an effect of pet type(dog/cat/none) on subjective well-being?
  
  + Is there an effect of personality(introvert/extrovert) on subjective well-being?
  
  + Does the effect of pet type on subjective well-being differ depending upon personality?
  

+ All 3 effects can be tested with a single test.

--

** Test Your Understanding:** Which of the above questions reference a main effect and which reference an interaction?

---
### The Logic Behind Factorial ANOVA

+ Recall from last week that ANOVAs evaluate two features in our data:

  + Variance in the dependent variable explained by the independent variable ( `\(SS_{model}\)`)
  
  + Variance in the dependent variable *not* explained by the independent variable ( `\(SS_{residual}\)`)

--

+ With a Factorial ANOVA, the only difference is that `\(SS_{model}\)` is comprised of the variance from each independent variable and their interaction(s):

---
### The Logic Behind Factorial ANOVA

.pull-left[
+ As with One-Way ANOVAs, `\(SS_{model}\)`  is calculated as the distance between the means of each group and the grand mean. 

+ If there is one IV with 3 groups, this distance is computed between the grand mean and each individual within each of the groups.

---
### The Logic Behind Factorial ANOVA

.pull-left[
+ When there are multiple IVs, `\(SS_{model}\)` is still calculated as the distance between the means of each group and the grand mean. 

&gt; **Test Your Understanding:** You have 2 between-subjects IVs. One has 2 levels and one has 3 levels. How many total possible groups do you have?

### Questions?

---
### Running a Factorial ANOVA

**Step 1: State Your Hypotheses**

+ 3 hypotheses (2 main effects and 1 interaction):

  + RQ1 - Does pet ownership affect subjective well-being?
      + `\(H_1\)` Pet ownership has an effect on subjective well-being
  
  + RQ2 - Is there an effect of personality type on subjective well being?
      + `\(H_1\)` Personality type has an effect on subjective well-being
    
  + RQ3 - Does the effect of pet ownership on subjective well-being change across personality types?
      + `\(H_1\)` The effect of pet ownership on subjective well-being is different across personality types.


---
### Running a Factorial ANOVA

+ Main Effects Hypotheses:
  
  + Main Effect of Pet:
      + `\(H_0: \mu_{cat} = \mu_{dog} = \mu_{none}\)`
      + `\(H_1:\)` at least one `\(\mu\)` is different from the other `\(\mu\)`s
    
  + Main Effect of Personality:
      + `\(H_0: \mu_{introvert} = \mu_{extrovert}\)`
      + `\(H_1: \mu_{introvert} \neq \mu_{extrovert}\)`
    
+ Interaction Effect:
  `\(C = (\mu_{introvert}\times\mu_{cat}-\mu_{introvert}\times\mu_{dog}-\mu_{introvert}\times\mu_{none}) - (\mu_{extrovert}\times\mu_{cat}-\mu_{extrovert}\times\mu_{dog}-\mu_{extrovert}\times\mu_{none})\)`
      + `\(H_0: C = 0\)`
      + `\(H_1: C \neq 0\)`


---
### Running a Factorial ANOVA

**Step 2: Conduct a Power Analysis**

+ [WebPower](https://webpower.psychstat.org/wiki/models/index)

+ You should run a power analysis for each effect of interest

--
&gt; **Test Your Understanding:** How many power analyses should you run in this instance?

---
### Running a Factorial ANOVA

**Step 2: Conduct a Power Analysis**

+ [WebPower](https://webpower.psychstat.org/wiki/models/index)

+ You should run a power analysis for each effect of interest

+ For this example, let's run an a priori power analysis to detect effect size.

  + These are useful when working with secondary data, where you already have a pre-existing dataset
  
  + Here, you calculate the effect size you can detect with a given sample.
  
  + Our dataset has 150 participants. Check the effect size we have 80% power to detect, given `\(\alpha\)` = .05.

+ Remember, Webpower computes the effect size `\(f\)`. We'll need to convert it back to `\(\eta^2\)` using the following formula:

`$$\eta^2 = \frac{f^2}{1+f^2}$$`

---
### Running a Factorial ANOVA

**Step 3: Check your data**

+ Compute descriptive statistics

+ Look at relevant plots
  
--

+ Open [these data](https://mtruelovehill.github.io/PRM/Data/petDat.sav) in SPSS.



---
### Running a Factorial ANOVA

**Step 4: Check Assumptions**

+ **Normality:** Residuals should be normally distributed

--

  + What are residuals, and why should they be normally distributed?

---
### Running a Factorial ANOVA

**Step 4: Check Assumptions**

+ **Normality:** Residuals should be normally distributed
    + Have a look at the histograms &amp; QQ-plots
  
+ **Independence:** Observations/individuals should be sampled independently
    + Consider study design
  
+ **Homogeneity of Variance:** Equal variance between each group/category
    + Visually assess the residuals vs predicted values plot
    + Support this with Levene's Test for between-subjects variables and Mauchly's test for within-subjects variables with &gt; 2 levels

### Running a Factorial ANOVA

**Step 5: Run the test**

**Step 6: Calculate the effect size**

**Step 7: Interpret results**

Let's continue in SPSS...

### Running a Factorial ANOVA

**Step 8: Report**

We conducted a **2x3 Factorial ANOVA** to determine the effect of &lt;span style = "color:#9AD079"&gt; &lt;b&gt; personality (levels: introversion; extroversion) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;span style = "color:#9AD079"&gt; &lt;b&gt; pet ownership (levels: cat; dog; none) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; on &lt;span style = "color:#9AD079"&gt; &lt;b&gt; subjective well-being &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. The `\(\alpha\)` threshold was set at .05 for all analyses. A sensitivity power analysis indicated that 150 participants were sufficient to detect an effect of `\(\eta^2\)` = .06 with a power of 80% and an `\(\alpha\)` threshold of .05.

Pet ownership did not significantly affect subjective well-being, &lt;span style = "color:#18778C"&gt;&lt;b&gt; `\(F\)`(2, 144) = 0.10, `\(p\)` = .908, `\(\eta^2\)` = .001 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Additionally, personality was not associated with subjective well-being, &lt;span style = "color:#18778C"&gt;&lt;b&gt; `\(F\)`(1, 144) = 0.02, `\(p\)` = .901, `\(\eta^2\)` &lt; .001 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. 

---
### Running a Factorial ANOVA

**Step 8: Report**

There was a significant interaction of pet ownership and personality on subjective well-being, &lt;span style = "color:#18778C"&gt;&lt;b&gt; `\(F\)`(2, 144) = 9.57, `\(p\)` &lt; .001, `\(\eta^2\)` = .12 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Simple effects analysis there was a significant difference in the effect of pet ownership on subjective well-being, depending on personality type. These effects were only observed in those who owned dogs, `\(F\)`(1, 144) = 7.77, `\(p\)` = .006, `\(\eta^2\)` = .05, and those who owned cats, `\(F\)`(1, 144) = 11.26, `\(p\)` = .001, `\(\eta^2\)` = .07. There was no significant effect of personality type in those who did not own a pet,  `\(F\)`(1, 144) = 0.12, `\(p\)` = .726, `\(\eta^2\)` = .001. Specifically, introverts who owned cats reported significantly higher levels of subjective well-being than extroverts who owned cats, `\(p\)` = .001. Conversely, extroverts who owned dogs reported significantly higher levels of subjective well-being than introverts who owned dogs, `\(p\)` = .006. Additionally, extroverted dog owners reported higher levels of subjective well-being than extroverted cat owners, `\(p\)` = .003, while introverted cat owners reported higher levels of subjective well-being than introverted dog owners, `\(p\)` = .020.

See Table 1 for descriptive data by group.
