## The `\(t\)`-test

+ `\(t\)`-tests take account of both the mean and the variance of the data to determine whether two means are significantly different from each other. 

+ `\(t\)`-tests produce a `\(t\)`-statistic that reflects the standardised difference between two mean values

--

+ Generally used to test the difference between two means

  + **One-sample `\(t\)`-tests** test the difference between a sample mean and a known mean
  
  + **Independent-sample `\(t\)`-tests** test the difference between two separate sample means
  
  + **Paired-samples `\(t\)`-tests** test the difference in a single sample at two points in time or across different conditions
  
--

+ Because of this, all `\(t\)`-tests require:

  + A continuous dependent variable
  
  + A categorical (binary) independent variable

---
## The `\(t\)`-test

+ Running a `\(t\)`-test involves:

  + Computing `\(t\)`
  
  + Calculating the probability of obtaining our value of `\(t\)` if the null were true

  + Using this probability to make a decision whether to reject the null hypothesis
  
---
## Calculating `\(t\)`

+ Although there are 3 types of `\(t\)`-tests, they generally involve some form of the following calculation:

`$$t = \frac{Observed\ Mean(s) - What\ we\ expect\ if\ null\ is\ true}{Some\ combination\ of\ the\ SE}$$`

---
## One-sample `\(t\)`-test

`$$t = \frac{\bar{x}-\mu_0}{SE_\bar{x}}$$`
+ Compare a sample mean ( `\(\bar{x}\)` ) and a known mean ( `\(\mu_0\)` )

+ Used to check whether your sample's mean is significantly different from a known value

--

+ **Example research questions:**

  + Are speeds along Road A significantly higher than the speed limit?
  
  + Do a beauty product's results last longer than 3 months?

---
## Independent-samples `\(t\)`-test

`$$t = \frac{(\bar{x_1}-\bar{x_2})-(\mu_1 - \mu_2)}{\sqrt{\frac{s_p^2}{n_1}+\frac{s_p^2}{n2}}}$$`
`\(s_p^2\)`: a pooled variance estimate that weights variance by sample size

--

+ Compares the mean of group 1 ( `\(\bar{x_1}\)` ) to the mean of group 2 ( `\(\bar{x_2}\)` )

+ Used to determine whether there is a difference between two independently measured groups

--

+ **Example research questions:**

  + Are there differences in symptoms between the treatment group and the group that received a placebo?
  
  + Do inmates who are put in solitary confinement exhibit more aggressive behaviour than those who are not?
  
  + Are there differences in TBI rate between boxers and Muay Thai fighters?
  
---
## Paired-samples `\(t\)`-test


`$$t = \frac{\bar{d}-\mu_d}{SE_\bar{d}}$$`


+ where:

  + `\(\bar{d}\)`: the mean of the individual difference scores (e.g. `\(d_i = x_{i1} - x_{i2}\)`)

  + `\(\mu_d\)`: The hypothesised null mean difference

  + `\(SE_\bar{d} = \frac{sd_\bar{d}}{\sqrt{n}}\)`

--

+ Compares the mean of the same group of participants across two timepoints/conditions

--

+ **Example research questions:**

  + Does time of day affect one's attention span?
  
  + Is a new fitness routine effective in improving one's cardiovascular health?

## The `\(t\)` distribution

.pull-left[
+ The `\(t\)`-distribution is the null distribution against which our calculated `\(t\)`-value is compared. 

+ The shape of the `\(t\)`-distribution depends on the degrees of freedom ( `\(df\)` ) of our data.

]

---
## Degrees of freedom

.pull-left[

+ The number of values within the data that are free to vary

+ df = items within dataset - parameters to be estimated

]


???

Imagine we have a set of 3 values and we know that the mean is 4. In this case, the parameter we wish to estimate is the mean, so there is 1 parameter. We have 3 values within our dataset. In this case, the degrees of freedom in this set is 2, because 3-1 is 2. To understand what this means in terms of 'free to vary', if we know the mean is 4, Value 1 could be anything...it could be 3 or 8, or 12. Value 2 could be the same, any value at all. But the third value is fixed, because it has to be whatever makes the mean equal to 4. So Value 1 and 2 are free to vary, but the 3rd value has a constraint, which is that it must be equal to whatever value makes the mean equal to 4.

## Degrees of freedom

.pull-left[

+ The number of values within the data that are free to vary

+ df = items within dataset - parameters to be estimated

+ The number of parameters we estimate depends on the type of `\(t\)`-test

]


.pull-right[
+ **One-sample `\(t\)`-test:** we estimate the &lt;span style = "color:#18778C"&gt; mean of our data &lt;/span&gt;
    + `\(df = n - 1\)`
  
+ **Independent samples `\(t\)`-test:** we estimate the &lt;span style = "color:#18778C"&gt; mean of each of our two groups &lt;/span&gt;
    + `\(df = n - 2\)`
  
+ **Paired-samples `\(t\)`-test:** we estimate the &lt;span style = "color:#18778C"&gt; mean difference between observations &lt;/span&gt;
    + `\(df = n - 1\)`

## The `\(t\)` distribution

.pull-left[
+ The `\(t\)`-distribution is the null distribution against which our calculated `\(t\)`-value is compared. 

+ The shape of the `\(t\)`-distribution depends on the degrees of freedom ( `\(df\)` ) of our data.

+ Consider how the shape of the distribution changes as `\(df\)` increases

**Test your Understanding:** What does the change in shape suggest?

## Putting it all together

.pull-left[
Basically:

1) Calculate your `\(t\)`-statistic

2) Identify the proper null distribution using `\(df\)`

3) Using this distribution, compute the probability of getting a `\(t\)`-statistic at least as extreme as yours

## Questions?

---

### Conducting a `\(t\)`-test...or really, most inferential statistical tests

1. State your hypothesis

2. Conduct a power analysis

3. Check your data (visualisations/descriptives)

4. Check assumptions

5. Run the test

6. Calculate the effect size/confidence intervals

7. Interpret results

8. Report

---

## A note about hypotheses...

+ Hypotheses may be directional, or make a prediction about the expected direction of the effect
  
  + Treatment X will **reduce** symptoms of anxiety
  
  + Test scores will **improve** as hour of study increase

+ Hypotheses can also be nondirectional. In this case, an effect is predicted, but the direction is not specified.

  + Treatment X will **have an effect** on symptoms of anxiety
  
  + Test scores will **be associated with** hours of study

--

+ Directional hypotheses can be tested with one-tailed tests, while nondirectional hypotheses can be tested with two-tailed tests

---
## One-Tailed vs Two-Tailed Tests

---
## Assumptions of `\(t\)`-tests

+ **Normality:** Dependent data should be normally distributed
  
--

.pull-left[

]
---
## Assumptions of `\(t\)`-tests

+ **Normality:** Dependent data should be normally distributed
  
+ **Independence:** Observations should be sampled independently

--

+ Independent-samples `\(t\)`-tests also require **Homogeneity of Variance:** Equal variance between the two groups

--

.pull-left[

]

---

## Effect size - Cohen's `\(d\)`

+ Cohen's `\(d\)` is the standardized difference between the means

  + in other words, how many standard deviations separate the two values?

`$$d = \frac{\bar{x}_1 -\bar{x}_2}{s_{pooled}}$$`

.pull-left[
+ `\(\bar{x}_1\)` = mean of group 1
+ `\(\bar{x}_2\)` = mean of group 2
+ `\(s_{pooled}\)` = pooled standard deviation
]

--

.pull-right[

`$$s_{pooled} = \sqrt{\frac{(n_1-1)s_1^2\ + (n_2-1)s_2^2}{n_1+n_2-2}}$$`

]


---

## Interpretation of Cohen's `\(d\)`

+ Proposed by Cohen (1998):


| Strength | Absolute Magnitude of `\(d\)` |
|:--------:|:-------------------------:|
| Weak     | `\(\leq\)` .20                |
| Moderate | `\(\approx\)` .50             |
| Strong   | `\(\geq\)` .8                 |



---
exclude: true
## Effect size - Cohen's `\(d\)`

+ Works best for larger samples...for smaller samples (&lt;50), it overinflates results **MONICA, VERIFY THIS**

---
## Checking Power

+ Recall that power usually involves some combination of the following values:
  
  + `\(\alpha\)`
  + Effect Size
  + Power
  + Sample Size
  
+ In almost all cases, we will set `\(\alpha = .05\)` and `\(Power = .8\)`

+ For `\(t\)`-tests, we'll use **Cohen's `\(d\)` ** as our effect size

## Running an Independent-Samples `\(t\)`-Test

**Step 1: State Your Hypotheses**

.pull-left[.center[&lt;span style = "color: #18778C"&gt; Null Hypothesis &lt;/span&gt;]
`$$H_0:  \bar{x_1} = \bar{x_2}$$`
]

.pull-right[.center[&lt;span style = "color: #18778C"&gt; Alternative Hypothesis &lt;/span&gt;]
&lt;b&gt; Nondirectional &lt;/b&gt;

`$$H_1: \bar{x_1} \neq \bar{x_2}$$`


&lt;b&gt; Directional &lt;/b&gt;


`$$H_1: \bar{x_1} &gt; \bar{x_2}$$`
`$$H_1: \bar{x_1} &lt; \bar{x_2}$$`
]

--

&gt; **Test Your Understanding:** If your research question is 'Are there differences in systolic blood pressure between the treatment group and the group that received a placebo?', what is your null hypothesis? What is your alternative hypothesis?

--

&gt; Is this a directional or nondirectional hypothesis? Do we need a one-tailed or two-tailed test?



---
## Running an Independent-Samples `\(t\)`-Test

**Step 2: Conduct a Power Analysis**

+ [WebPower](https://webpower.psychstat.org/wiki/models/index)

+ Let's check the sample required to achieve 80% power to detect a moderate effect ( `\(d\)` = .5) with `\(\alpha\)` = .05.

+ Remember, our research question is 'Are there differences in systolic blood pressure between the treatment group and the group that received a placebo?'

---
## Running an Independent-Samples `\(t\)`-Test

**Step 3: Check your data**

+ Compute descriptive statistics

+ Look at relevant plots
  
--

+ Let's do this in SPSS using [these data](https://mtruelovehill.github.io/PRM/Data/BPdat.csv).


---
## Running an Independent-Samples `\(t\)`-Test

**Step 4: Check Assumptions**

+ Normality
  
  + Have a look at the histograms &amp; QQ-plots
  + May also run tests of normality (Shapiro-Wilk or Kolmogorov–Smirnov)

We conducted a **two-tailed independent-samples `\(t\)`-test** to determine the effect of &lt;span style = "color:#9AD079"&gt; &lt;b&gt; treatment &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; on &lt;span style = "color:#9AD079"&gt; &lt;b&gt;systolic blood pressure (SBP) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. There was a significant effect of treatment, &lt;span style = "color:#18778C"&gt;&lt;b&gt; `\(t\)`(128) = -3.16, `\(p\)` = .002, 95% CI = [-4.68, -1.08], `\(d\)` = -.55 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Specifically, SBP in the treatment group was lower &lt;span style = "color:#19424C"&gt;&lt;b&gt; ( `\(M\)` = 136.97, `\(SD\)` = 4.86)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; than SBP in the placebo group &lt;span style = "color:#19424C"&gt;&lt;b&gt;( `\(M\)` = 139.85, `\(SD\)` = 5.50)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
