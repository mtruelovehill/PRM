This indicates that super-recognisers correctly identified more faces than the typical group. Although they demonstrated better identification ability, it is unclear whether they did so by focusing on the whole face rather than specific regions. It is possible that they used a similar strategy to the typical group, but their memory for facial characteristics was more efficient." &lt;/font&gt;

## Be clear.

+ Have you already done the study? Yes? Then why are you writing about it in future or present tense?

  + In almost all cases, **you should be writing in past tense**.

+ Don't be vague about what is being tested, particularly when you have used multiple measures or have several hypotheses.

&lt;font size=2.5&gt; We utilized a one-way ANOVA to test whether intervention group status significantly affected BDI scores. Our results indicated that intervention type was significant, &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt; (2, 147) = 14.13, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; .001, &amp;eta;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = .16 [.08, 1.00]. Post-hoc analyses using Tukey's tests found that participants in Group A scored higher (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt; = 17.62, &lt;i&gt;SD&lt;/i&gt; = 5.21) than those in Groups B (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt; = 12.11, &lt;i&gt;SD&lt;/i&gt; = 8.20), &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; .001 and C (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt; = 10.22, &lt;i&gt;SD&lt;/i&gt; = 9.26), &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; .001. There was no significant difference in BDI scores between Groups B and C, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = .635. This suggests that Intervention A was less effective than Interventions B and C in reducing depressive symptoms. We then examined whether intervention group status significantly affected BAI scores. Our results indicated that intervention type was significant, &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt; (2, 147) = 8.22, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; .001, &amp;eta;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = .10 [.04, .93]).

## Be efficient. 




+ **Don't put the same results in the text AND a table.** Pick one.
  + If you only have results from a single test to report, report it in text.
  + If you have results from a large regression with multiple predictors, a table might be a better option.

&lt;font size=3&gt;  &lt;B&gt; Learning Approach: Leaning In &lt;/B&gt;

This sociology major described her experience of leaning in:
"There was so much work, a lot of which was hard for me to understand, but I continued to push myself to understand it. I took notes, I read as much as I could and while there were certain concepts that I really couldn’t grasp, I'm a hard-working student, so I was willing to go above and beyond."

&lt;font size=3&gt; &lt;B&gt; Learning Approach: Leaning In &lt;/B&gt; 


Some students used a learning approach that involved “embracing the challenge”; they “leaned in”. Leaning in behaviors included not missing class, doing the reading, meeting with the professor, forming study groups, and seeking out additional resources. This sociology major described her experience of leaning in:
"There was so much work, a lot of which was hard for me to understand, but I continued to push myself to understand it. I took notes, I read as much as I could and while there were certain concepts that I really couldn’t grasp, I'm a hard-working student, so I was willing to go above and beyond."

## Be informative.

**Quantitative**

+ Provide detailed results from your tests, **not just a `\(p\)`-value** (see [Sullivan &amp; Feinn](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3444174/)).
  + Statistical test used 
  + Test statistic value (e.g., `\(F\)`, `\(\beta\)`)
  + Degrees of freedom 
  + `\(p\)`-value (up to 3 decimal places)
  + Effect sizes and confidence intervals.
